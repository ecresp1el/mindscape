# Bioinformatics Workflow Engine

## Overview
The Bioinformatics Workflow Engine is a modular, scalable, and Pythonic framework designed to facilitate the execution of bioinformatics pipelines. It allows users to define, manage, and execute workflows in a structured manner, promoting reusability and composability.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Each workflow is encapsulated in its own module, promoting clean and maintainable code.
- **Composable Workflows**: Workflows can be easily chained or branched, allowing for complex analysis pipelines.
- **Reusable Components**: Common logic is abstracted into utility functions, reducing code duplication.
- **Extendable Architecture**: New workflows can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To execute workflows, use the `run_workflows.py` script. This script loads the configuration and manages the execution of workflows based on the defined order in `workflow_order.yaml`.
